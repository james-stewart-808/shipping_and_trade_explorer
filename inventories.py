    One of the key intentions of the dashboard is to summarise shipping activity associated with alternative countries. \
    For the purposes of the dashboard, we will use identification and analysis of voyages as the primary mechanism through \
    which to explore trends in maritime activity associated with each country. Specifically, we will consider collections, \
    or ‘inventories’, of voyage records associated with internationally arriving voyages and international departing voyages.\
    the movement of goods by sea and resulting in a dataset representing 618.2 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.

    Voyage data is taken from the 4th IMO GHG Study (Faber et al, 2020). The study utilises AIS to understand the activity \
    profiles of individual vessels, then introduces vessel specification datasets that enable the energy demands, fuel \
    consumption and GHG emissions of vessel activity to be estimated. A full summary of the methodology used to estimate \
    GHG emissions from AIS data is presented in **Annex 1** of the Method Statement document. Initially comprised of 58,539 \
    voyages, the dataset is first filtered for vessel types associated with the international merchant fleet facilitating \
    the movement of goods by sea and resulting in a dataset representing 618.2 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.
